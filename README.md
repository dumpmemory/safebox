# Safebox

An unified key management system to make life easier. 

The main goal of safebox is to make key backup easier with single main key to derive the reset. You only need to backup **ONE** file about **256KB** to your removable disk, such as floppy disk/thumb drive/mo disk(magneto optical)/dvd-ram, etc...

# Safebox Can Derive Keys For:

1. SSH
2. Ethereum
3. Bitcoin
4. Atom
5. Band
6. Persistence
7. Kava
8. Akash
9. Filecoin

and more plugable export plugin keeping coming...

**Unlimited** keys can be derived with a single main key, but we still suggest one master key for 16384 derived keys.

# TUI

Safebox is designed with a **retro-style** text-based user interface(tui), so a box such as Raspberry Pi will be able to act as key mangement box for offline storage. And keys can be obtain via text-based **QR-Code**.
