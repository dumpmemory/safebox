# Safebox

An unified key management system to make life easier. 

The main goal of safebox is to make key backup easier with single main key to derive the reset. You only need to backup **ONE** file about 256KB to your removable disk, such as floppy disk/thumb drive/mo disk(magneto optical)/dvd-ram, etc...

# Safebox Can derive

1. SSH Key
2. Ethereum Key
3. Bitcoin Key
4. and more plugable export plugin keeping coming.

Up to 16384 keys can be derived with a single main key.

# TUI

Safebox is designed with a DOS style text-based user interface(tui), so a box such as Raspberry Pi will be able to act as key mangement box for offline storage.
